## Life Numbers

This is one of the first projects I started working on post bootcamp. It serves two purposes:
- Help me land a job
- Help me learn more about myself

### The Inspiration

One of the hardest questions for me to answer is "what kind of person are you." People sometimes ask that casually, and other times, people ask that during job interviews. I used to have bold answers. "My friends say I'm loyal. Uh I am persistent, I love learning new things. I like cloudy weather...". But I realized that there were moments in my life that challenged my own image of myself. And of course, one broken promise doesn't all of the sudden make me a conpulsive liar, and forgetting a friend's birthday doesn't make me an unloyal friend. But the issue is that these moments made me think twice about myself. So when people ask me now, "what kind of person are you?", I start with "I don't know. But I think I typically like -... I think [insert something] makes me happy...".

Back in college I remember I became interested in personality tests. I wanted more definitive answers about myself, who I was, what tendencies I had. But during my research I came across a great Quora answer. The author of the post stated that he had been tracking his daily habits and routines for the past 5 or so years. He would record things like when he slept, when he woke up, how much he weighed, etc. And most importantly of all, he recorded how he felt during the day (postive to negative scale). And then he took that data and tried to figure out what things in his life correlated to him having a better day. And he made changes in his life in order to find the perfect balance that would lead to him feeling more fulfillment and joy. I remember resonating with this method. It felt more methodical, and data-driven.

This project is meant to be the tool that helps me to accomplish this data collection aspect. By making this a mobile application, I hope that the inputting of data is a lot less burdensome.

If you have any questions, or ideas to help me along the way, please reach out! I'd love to hear from you. If you read this far, thank you, sincerely.
